# A group is comprised of a number of participants. Can have multiple groups. Each group has a name, an associated budget, an exchange day
# A participant has a name, a date of birth, a gender, another participant they're matched with, a wishlist. They can buy gifts from the Market.
# A market has a name, a number of gifts on offer and a number of participants that interact with it
# A gift will have a name, a price, a seller (market), a description
# Some participants will be admins (is-a relationship). They are similar to normal group members, except they control who gets added and can remove people from the group
